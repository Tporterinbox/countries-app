==================================
🧠 VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
==================================

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint?
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type?
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data t ype?

2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?

3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?

4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
   - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint?
   - render anything in JSX?
   - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
   - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
     Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language.

✨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.

==================================
📊 FORM DATA
==================================

========================
🔶 STORING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): --> Post
API ENDPOINT: -->add-one-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): --> object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ string
RESPONSE: ------Success! User has been added.

========================/------------------
🔶 RETRIEVING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ----> GET
API ENDPOINT: -->  /get-newest-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): --N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ----N/A

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ---> array with one object
RESPONSE: ------[
  [
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]

❓ WHEN: ------when the saved countries page loads

❓ WHERE: ------ On the saved countries page

❓ HOW:
Step 1: ---  user fills out form and submits it
Step 2: ----Make a functiin called getNewsetUserData- async function-, uses fetch to send get request to the endpoint called /get-newest-user. Then the function saves the data to a state variable called newestUserData
Step 3: ------we will use useEffect to call the function getNewestData on page loading
step 4:Render the newest user's name to the screen in JSX.

📊 COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
=================================

========================
🔶 STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
========================
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------Post 
API ENDPOINT: ------> /update-one-country-count

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------> Object 
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------
{
  "country_name": "France"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------> string, with boolean --??
RESPONSE: ------
{
  "count": 3
}
❓ WHEN: ------
